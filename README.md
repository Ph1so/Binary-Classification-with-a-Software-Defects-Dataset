### Machine Learning Model for Binary Classification

# Overview

Welcome to the repository containing the Google Colab notebook for building a machine learning model for the "Binary Classification with a Software Defects Dataset" competition on Kaggle. In this project, I developed a machine learning model that accurately predicts the presence or absence of software defects based on relevant features.

# Dataset

The dataset used for this project is sourced from the "Binary Classification with a Software Defects Dataset" competition on Kaggle. It comprises 100,000 samples with 21 features. Detailed information about the dataset can be found on the Kaggle competition page.

# Google Colab Notebook

The Google Colab notebook included in this repository contains the code and documentation for building and evaluating the machine learning model. The notebook is structured as follows:

- Data Loading and Exploration: Loading the dataset and performing exploratory data analysis to gain insights into the data distribution and feature characteristics.
- Model Building: Implementing machine learning algorithms, including data splitting, and model training.
- Model Evaluation: Assessing the performance of the trained model using appropriate evaluation metrics and visualization techniques.
- Submission Preparation: Preparing the submission file with predictions for the Kaggle competition.

# Results

Currently, the trained model achieved a ROC AUC score of 66%.
